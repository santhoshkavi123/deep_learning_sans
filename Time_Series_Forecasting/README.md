M5 Forecasting

Overview

The M5 Forecasting competition aims to predict sales for thousands of products sold across various stores. It provides historical sales data and additional external features to build forecasting models that can accurately estimate future demand.

Dataset

The dataset consists of:

Sales Data: Historical sales records for individual products.

Calendar Data: Information on special events, holidays, and the corresponding dates.

Sell Prices: Price history of the products across different stores.

Validation & Evaluation Data: Used to measure model performance.

Problem Statement

The objective is to predict the unit sales for each product over the forecast horizon using historical sales data, external features, and pricing information. The challenge requires handling high-dimensional time series data effectively.

Evaluation Metric

The competition uses the Weighted Root Mean Squared Scaled Error (WRMSSE) metric to evaluate the accuracy of predictions.

Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values in the dataset.

Aggregating time-series data for different levels (store, category, department, state).

Feature engineering: creating lag-based, rolling window, and categorical encoding features.

Model Approaches

Various forecasting approaches can be used, including:

Statistical Methods: ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing.

Machine Learning Models: Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM.

Deep Learning Models: LSTMs, Transformers.

Hybrid Approaches: Combining multiple techniques for better generalization.

Implementation Steps

Load and preprocess the dataset.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns.

Engineer useful features from time-series data.

Train multiple forecasting models.

Validate and fine-tune model hyperparameters.

Generate and submit final predictions.

Results

A comparative analysis of models is performed to determine the best-performing approach based on WRMSSE.

Tools & Libraries

Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, lightgbm, tensorflow, statsmodels)

Jupyter Notebook for development

Kaggle API for dataset access
